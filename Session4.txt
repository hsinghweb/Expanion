Learning from Cache project:
--------------------------------
* Cache and various cache types: FIFO, LRU, LFU
Enterprise cache: ECache, Hazelcast
* Java Languange
* Eclipse
* Java concepts: Inner Class, Generics, Collections
* Data Structures: SinglyLinkedList, DoublyLinkedList

----------------
Agenda
----------------
* Use of a simple cache in Factorial program
* Algorithm vs Data Structure
* SinglyLinkedList
* DoublyLinkedList
* Generics
* FIFO Cache
* LRU Cache
* LFU Cache

* Interview Questions on LinkedList
  * find the nth to last element of a singly linked list. (like 2nd last or 3rd last)
  * find the middle element of a singly linked list.
  * delete a node in the middle of a single linked list, given only access to that node.
  * Find if linked list contains loop. If yes then implement an algorithm which returns node at the beginning of the loop.
  * Find the merging node of 2 linked lists.
